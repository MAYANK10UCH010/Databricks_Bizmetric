# Retirement Planning – A More Rigorous Yet Intuitive Indian Analysis

This document rebuilds the earlier ₹50,000/month retirement example using:
1. Inflation-adjusted cash flows  
2. Comparison of ×30, ×40, ×50 corpus rules  
3. Monte Carlo–style intuition (without heavy mathematics)

All assumptions are stated explicitly.

## Base Assumptions (Indian Context)

| Parameter | Assumption |
|--------|------------|
| Retirement age | 55 |
| Planning horizon | 35 years (till age 90) |
| Monthly expenses today | ₹50,000 |
| Annual expenses today | ₹6,00,000 |
| General inflation | 6% |
| Healthcare inflation | 9% |
| Equity nominal return | 12% |
| Fixed income nominal return | 7% |
| Portfolio (initial) | 60% equity, 40% debt |
| Expected real return (blended) | ~4% |

---

## 1️⃣ Rebuilding the Example Using Inflation-Adjusted Cash Flows

### Step 1: Expense Growth Over Time

Expenses are **not constant**.

$$
\text{Expense}_t = \text{Expense}_0 \times (1 + \text{Inflation})^t
$$

- ₹6 lakh today
- After 20 years (6% inflation): ~₹19.2 lakh
- After 30 years: ~₹34.5 lakh

👉 This is the **single biggest missing element** in simple rules.

---

### Step 2: Real Returns (Key Scientific Concept)

Instead of using nominal returns, we think in **real terms**:

$$
\text{Real Return} = \text{Nominal Return} - \text{Inflation}
$$

Approximate blended portfolio:
- Nominal ≈ 9–10%
- Inflation ≈ 6%
- **Real return ≈ 3–4%**

This means:
> Your corpus grows slowly *after* beating inflation.

---

### Step 3: What the Corpus Is Really Doing

Your retirement corpus is simultaneously:
- Growing at ~3–4% real return  
- Shrinking due to withdrawals  
- Being stressed by rising expenses  

Hence, **capital preservation is not guaranteed**, only *probabilistic*.

## 2️⃣ Comparing ×30, ×40, ×50 Corpus Rules (India)

### Corpus Values for ₹50,000/month Expenses

| Rule | Corpus | Annual Withdrawal |
|----|-------|------------------|
| ×30 | ₹1.8 crore | ₹6 lakh (3.33%) |
| ×40 | ₹2.4 crore | ₹6 lakh (2.5%) |
| ×50 | ₹3.0 crore | ₹6 lakh (2.0%) |

---

### Sustainability Under Indian Conditions

| Corpus Rule | Survival Probability (35 yrs) | Risk Profile |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| ×30 | Low | Fails under high inflation / bad early returns |
| ×40 | Medium | Works in average markets |
| ×50 | High | Survives most stress scenarios |

Interpretation:
- ×30 assumes **everything goes right**
- ×40 assumes **normal markets**
- ×50 assumes **bad luck protection**

---

## 3️⃣ Monte Carlo–Style Intuition (Without Math)

Monte Carlo simulation simply means:

> “Let’s test thousands of possible futures instead of assuming one straight-line future.”

---

### What Random Futures Look Like

In reality:
- Some years equity returns = +25%
- Some years = –30%
- Inflation spikes occasionally
- Medical expenses surge late in life

The **order of returns matters** (sequence risk).

---

### Sequence Risk Example (Critical Insight)

Two retirees earn the **same average return**:

- Retiree A: bad returns in early years ❌
- Retiree B: bad returns in later years ✅

Retiree A is far more likely to **run out of money**, even if averages match.

---

### How Each Corpus Handles Random Futures

| Corpus | Bad Early Market | High Inflation | Longevity Risk |
|------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| ×30 | ❌ Fails | ❌ Fails | ❌ Fails |
| ×40 | ⚠️ Sometimes | ⚠️ Moderate | ⚠️ Moderate |
| ×50 | ✅ Survives | ✅ Survives | ✅ Strong |

This is why professionals prefer **probability-based planning**, not single formulas.

---

## Key Takeaways (Important)

1. **Simple multipliers are heuristics, not science**
2. Inflation-adjusted modeling is non-negotiable
3. India needs **lower withdrawal rates** than the US
4. ×50 is conservative but inefficient
5. ×40 is balanced for most disciplined investors
6. ×30 is aggressive and risky in India

---

## Final Practical Guidance

| Investor Type | Recommended Rule |
|--------------|-----------------|
| High risk tolerance, pension backup | ×30 |
| Normal salaried professional | ×40 |
| No pension, health risk, conservative | ×45–×50 |

---

## Bottom Line

The original snapshot formula is:
- **Logically valid**
- **Directionally safe**
- **Scientifically incomplete**

A proper retirement plan is **probabilistic**, not deterministic.

> Retirement planning is not about finding *one correct number*  
> It is about **maximizing the probability of not running out of money**.
