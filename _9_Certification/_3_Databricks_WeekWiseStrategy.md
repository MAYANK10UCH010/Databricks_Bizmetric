# ðŸ“… 3-Month Study Plan for Databricks Certifications  
(GenAI Associate â†’ Data Engineer Associate â†’ Machine Learning Associate)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Month 1 â†’ GenAI Associate (Foundation in LLMs & GenAI)  
**Goal**: Get certified quickly, build confidence, understand Databricks GenAI stack.

### Week 1  
- Create/free Databricks Community Edition account.  
- Complete **Databricks Generative AI Fundamentals** course (Academy).  
- Learn: Basics of LLMs, embeddings, vector databases, MLflow for LLMs.  
- Practice: Run simple Python notebooks â†’ experiment with OpenAI/Hugging Face models locally in Databricks.  

### Week 2  
- Review **Vector Search + RAG concepts** (simulate with FAISS in Python on Free Edition).  
- Build a mini-project:  
  - Load a text dataset (e.g., Wikipedia extract).  
  - Embed with Hugging Face model.  
  - Search embeddings with cosine similarity.  
- Revise practice quizzes from Academy.  
- Take the **GenAI Associate exam**.

## ðŸ”¹ Month 2 â†’ Data Engineer Associate (Spark + Delta Foundations)  
**Goal**: Build solid Spark + Delta skills.

### Week 3  
- Start **Data Engineer Associate Learning Path** (Databricks Academy).  
- Learn: Medallion Architecture, Databricks workspace basics, Spark DataFrame fundamentals.  
- Practice in CE:  
  - Load CSV/JSON into DataFrames.  
  - Transform using Spark SQL & PySpark.  
  - Save as Delta tables.  

### Week 4  
- Deep dive into **Delta Lake features**: ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel.  
- Practice:  
  - Insert, update, delete from Delta tables.  
  - Version rollback.  
  - Simple ETL pipeline â†’ bronze â†’ silver â†’ gold tables.  

### Week 5  
- Focus on **Data ingestion + transformations**.  
- Practice:  
  - Autoloader (simulate in CE with batch ingestion).  
  - Partitioning and optimization.  
  - SQL queries for joins, aggregations, window functions.  
- End of Week 5 â†’ Take **mock/practice exams**.  

### Week 6  
- Revise **job orchestration, workflows, and security basics** (conceptual, since CE doesnâ€™t allow full workflows).  
- Review all practice tests + error notes.  
- Take the **Data Engineer Associate exam**.

## ðŸ”¹ Month 3 â†’ Machine Learning Associate (MLflow + ML in Databricks)  
**Goal**: Learn ML workflow, experiment tracking, feature engineering.

### Week 7  
- Start **Machine Learning Associate Learning Path** (Academy).  
- Learn: MLflow basics â†’ tracking, logging params/metrics, model registry.  
- Practice in CE:  
  - Train a scikit-learn logistic regression.  
  - Log metrics + models with MLflow.  

### Week 8  
- Feature engineering + model training with PySpark ML.  
- Practice:  
  - Load dataset (Titanic / Wine Quality).  
  - Split train/test.  
  - Build Spark ML pipeline (VectorAssembler + RandomForestClassifier).  
  - Log with MLflow.  

### Week 9  
- Learn: Feature Store concepts (simulate manually with Delta tables in CE).  
- Practice:  
  - Save engineered features as Delta.  
  - Reuse in another model training.  
- Study deployment basics (conceptual in CE, since serving is not available).  

### Week 10  
- Revise Academy course + review MLflow API docs.  
- End of Week 10 â†’ Take **mock/practice exams**.  

### Week 11  
- Fill gaps:  
  - Review weak topics (model lifecycle, MLflow registry).  
  - Do at least 2 full timed mock exams.  

### Week 12  
- Light revision of all notes.  
- Take the **Machine Learning Associate exam**. ðŸŽ¯
