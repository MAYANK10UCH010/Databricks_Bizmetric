# Can we practice Auto ML over Databricks Free Edition?  
### Also: Suggest the best source and strategy for preparing for Databricks certifications (GenAI Associate, Machine Learning Associate, Data Engineer Associate, followed by Professional Certifications).  
If they can be ranked based on difficulty, please do that as well.

## ‚úÖ Answer

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ AutoML on Databricks Free Edition
- **Databricks AutoML** (the built-in low-code ML feature) is available only on **paid tiers (Standard/Premium/Enterprise)**, **not** on the Free Community Edition.  
- On **Free Edition**, you can still:
  - Use **MLlib (Spark ML)** pipelines manually for classification/regression.  
  - Build AutoML-like workflows by integrating **Hyperopt**, **MLflow**, or open-source tools like **FLAML** or **Auto-sklearn**.  
  - Train small models on structured datasets, log experiments with **MLflow**, and simulate hyperparameter sweeps.  
- ‚úÖ If your main goal is **learning** ‚Üí Free Edition is enough.  
- ‚úÖ For **cert exam prep**, Spark ML, MLflow, and feature engineering are more important than AutoML.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For true Databricks AutoML practice ‚Üí you‚Äôll need a **paid trial (14-day)** or a **work/school Databricks account**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Databricks Certifications: Best Strategy  

Here‚Äôs a roadmap with **certifications in logical order** and their **relative difficulty ranking**:

#### ü•á Entry Level
1. **Databricks Generative AI Fundamentals (Associate)**  
   - *Level*: Easiest  
   - *Focus*: Intro to LLMs, prompt engineering, vector databases, MLflow for LLMs.  
   - *Prep*: Databricks free learning modules + documentation. Mostly conceptual, very light coding.  

2. **Databricks Data Engineer Associate**  
   - *Level*: Easy ‚Üí Medium  
   - *Focus*: Spark SQL, Delta Lake basics, ETL design, ingestion, transformations.  
   - *Prep*: Practice notebooks in Community Edition, Delta Live Tables concepts, Medallion Architecture.  

#### ü•à Intermediate
3. **Databricks Machine Learning Associate**  
   - *Level*: Medium  
   - *Focus*: ML pipelines, MLflow tracking/registry, feature store, model deployment.  
   - *Prep*:  
     - Build small models in PySpark/MLflow.  
     - Review MLflow, Feature Store, AutoML concepts.  
     - Study Databricks ML runtime features.  

#### ü•â Advanced / Professional
4. **Databricks Data Engineer Professional**  
   - *Level*: Harder  
   - *Focus*: Advanced Spark performance tuning, Delta Lake internals, streaming pipelines, scaling.  
   - *Prep*: Real hands-on with partitioning, optimization, Z-Ordering, Structured Streaming.  

5. **Databricks Machine Learning Professional**  
   - *Level*: Hardest  
   - *Focus*: End-to-end ML lifecycle, productionization, advanced MLflow, distributed training, advanced AutoML, MLOps.  
   - *Prep*: Requires **real project experience** (beyond CE).

### üî¢ Difficulty Ranking (easiest ‚Üí hardest)
1. GenAI Associate  
2. Data Engineer Associate  
3. Machine Learning Associate  
4. Data Engineer Professional  
5. Machine Learning Professional  

---

### ‚úÖ Strategy for Success
- **Step 1**: Start with **GenAI Associate** (conceptual, quick win).  
- **Step 2**: Move to **Data Engineer Associate** (builds Spark & Delta foundation).  
- **Step 3**: Take **ML Associate** (applies Spark + MLflow).  
- **Step 4‚Äì5**: Attempt **Professional** certs once comfortable (require deeper hands-on).  

---

### üìö Best Sources
- **Databricks Academy (free courses)** ‚Üí official prep for each exam.  
- **Databricks Documentation** ‚Üí Delta Lake, Spark SQL, MLflow.  
- **Practice Exams (official + community GitHub repos)** ‚Üí check readiness.  
- **Hands-on in Free Edition** ‚Üí Spark, Delta, MLflow basics.
