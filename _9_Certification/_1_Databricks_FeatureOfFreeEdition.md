# Question  
Can we practice Auto ML over Databricks Free Edition. Suggest the best source and Strategy for preparing for Databricks certifications.  
Starting with GenAI Associate, Machine learning Associate and Data Engineer Associate followed by Professional Certification. If they can be ranked based on Level of difficult do that for me as well.

# Answer  

Great set of questions üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôre thinking about this the right way. Let‚Äôs break it into two parts: **(1) AutoML on Databricks Free Edition** and **(2) Strategy for preparing for Databricks certifications (ranked by difficulty).**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ AutoML on Databricks Free Edition
- **Databricks AutoML** (the built-in low-code ML feature) is available only on **paid tiers (Standard/Premium/Enterprise)**, **not** on the Free Community Edition.  
- On **Free Edition**, you can still:
  - Use **MLlib (Spark ML)** pipelines manually for classification/regression.
  - Build AutoML-like workflows by integrating **Hyperopt**, **MLflow**, or open-source **FLAML/Auto-sklearn** inside Databricks.
  - Train small models on structured datasets, log experiments with **MLflow**, and simulate hyperparameter sweeps.
- ‚úÖ Strategy: If your main goal is **learning**, Free Edition is enough. For hands-on **cert exam prep**, you don‚Äôt need AutoML; Spark ML, MLflow, and feature engineering practice are more important.  
- If you want **true Databricks AutoML practice**, you‚Äôll need a **trial (14-day)** or **work/school Databricks account**.
