### Why Patterns Matter

Patterns aren’t magical — they don’t make code “better” automatically. They’re just common language for design decisions. If you say "I used Singleton for the logger," any dev instantly knows what you mean. They help avoid reinventing the wheel in messy ways.

### Conclusion

Think of LLD patterns as the “**_grammar of object-oriented design_**.” Once you know them, you can write cleaner, modular, and more maintainable code.
