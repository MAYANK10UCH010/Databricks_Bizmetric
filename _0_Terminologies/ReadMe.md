#### Read it for brief insights 
- The **five components of AI** are: Learning, Reasoning, Problem-Solving, Perception, and Natural Language Processing/Linguistic Intelligence.
- Top-K and Top-P are **sampling methods** in Large Language Models (LLMs) used to control the next word chosen by limiting the candidate pool. Top-K selects a fixed number, K, of the most probable tokens, whereas Top-P (or **nucleus sampling**) selects tokens by accumulating probabilities until a threshold, P, is met, dynamically adjusting the pool size

## Question  
**How much Spark and SQL shall be known by a Data Scientist?**

## Answer  

The ‚Äúhow much Spark and SQL does a Data Scientist need‚Äù question is a bit like asking *how much physics should an engineer know*. The answer is: enough to do the job well, but not necessarily to design particle accelerators. Let‚Äôs slice it cleanly:

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- You need SQL almost everywhere because data lives in databases and warehouses.  
- A Data Scientist should be fluent enough to:  
  - Query, filter, and join multiple tables.  
  - Use window functions (ranking, partitioning, running totals).  
  - Aggregate and group effectively.  
  - Write subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions).  
  - Understand performance basics (indexes, avoiding Cartesian joins, why GROUP BY matters).  

üëâ Think of SQL as your scalpel for data: you must cut cleanly before you can model anything.  

### Spark (Distributed Computing Framework)
- Spark comes in when your data outgrows memory on a single machine (think hundreds of GBs ‚Üí TBs).  
- For a Data Scientist, the essentials are:  
  - Knowing how to load and transform large datasets (filter, groupBy, join) using PySpark or Spark SQL.  
  - Understanding lazy evaluation and actions vs transformations (to avoid ‚Äúwhy is my job hanging?‚Äù moments).  
  - Writing Spark SQL when needed (it‚Äôs similar to standard SQL but distributed).  
  - Some exposure to Spark MLlib pipelines is useful, but most DS work uses scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch etc. Spark ML is handy for huge datasets where scikit-learn would choke.  

‚ö†Ô∏è You don‚Äôt need to be a Spark cluster administrator (configuring executors, tuning memory per node). That‚Äôs a Data Engineer‚Äôs bread and butter. But you should be comfortable running Spark jobs, debugging common errors, and optimizing joins/partitions for performance.  

### In Short
- **SQL: deep enough to be second nature.** You‚Äôll touch it daily.  
- **Spark: working knowledge.** Enough to handle large datasets, write efficient transformations, and not drown when your pipeline runs at scale.  

It‚Äôs like driving: SQL is learning to steer, brake, accelerate‚Äîcore to movement. Spark is like learning to drive a truck vs a car: same principles, just scaled up.
