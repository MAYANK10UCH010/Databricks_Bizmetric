#### Read it for brief insights 
- The **five components of AI** are: Learning, Reasoning, Problem-Solving, Perception, and Natural Language Processing/Linguistic Intelligence.
- Top-K and Top-P are **sampling methods** in Large Language Models (LLMs) used to control the next word chosen by limiting the candidate pool. Top-K selects a fixed number, K, of the most probable tokens, whereas Top-P (or **nucleus sampling**) selects tokens by accumulating probabilities until a threshold, P, is met, dynamically adjusting the pool size

## Question  
**How much Spark and SQL shall be known by a Data Scientist?**

## Answer  

The ‚Äúhow much Spark and SQL does a Data Scientist need‚Äù question is a bit like asking *how much physics should an engineer know*. The answer is: enough to do the job well, but not necessarily to design particle accelerators. Let‚Äôs slice it cleanly:

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- You need SQL almost everywhere because data lives in databases and warehouses.  
- A Data Scientist should be fluent enough to:  
  - Query, filter, and join multiple tables.  
  - Use window functions (ranking, partitioning, running totals).  
  - Aggregate and group effectively.  
  - Write subqueries, CTEs (Common Table Expressions).  
  - Understand performance basics (indexes, avoiding Cartesian joins, why GROUP BY matters).  

üëâ Think of SQL as your scalpel for data: you must cut cleanly before you can model anything.  

### Spark (Distributed Computing Framework)
- Spark comes in when your data outgrows memory on a single machine (think hundreds of GBs ‚Üí TBs).  
- For a Data Scientist, the essentials are:  
  - Knowing how to load and transform large datasets (filter, groupBy, join) using PySpark or Spark SQL.  
  - Understanding lazy evaluation and actions vs transformations (to avoid ‚Äúwhy is my job hanging?‚Äù moments).  
  - Writing Spark SQL when needed (it‚Äôs similar to standard SQL but distributed).  
  - Some exposure to Spark MLlib pipelines is useful, but most DS work uses scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch etc. Spark ML is handy for huge datasets where scikit-learn would choke.  

‚ö†Ô∏è You don‚Äôt need to be a Spark cluster administrator (configuring executors, tuning memory per node). That‚Äôs a Data Engineer‚Äôs bread and butter. But you should be comfortable running Spark jobs, debugging common errors, and optimizing joins/partitions for performance.  

### In Short
- **SQL: deep enough to be second nature.** You‚Äôll touch it daily.  
- **Spark: working knowledge.** Enough to handle large datasets, write efficient transformations, and not drown when your pipeline runs at scale.  

It‚Äôs like driving: SQL is learning to steer, brake, accelerate‚Äîcore to movement. Spark is like learning to drive a truck vs a car: same principles, just scaled up.

# Data Scientist‚Äôs Spark & SQL Syllabus

## SQL Skills (Core)
‚úÖ SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING  
‚úÖ JOINS (inner, outer, cross)  
‚úÖ Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, moving averages, lag/lead)  
‚úÖ Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
‚úÖ Aggregations and rollups (SUM, COUNT, GROUPING SETS)  
‚úÖ NULL handling (COALESCE, ISNULL)  
‚úÖ Performance basics: indexes, query plans (EXPLAIN), avoiding Cartesian joins  

---

## Spark Skills (Practical Level for DS)
### Foundations
‚úÖ Understand Spark architecture (Driver, Executors, Cluster Manager)  
‚úÖ Lazy evaluation: **transformations** (map, filter, join) vs **actions** (count, collect, write)  
‚úÖ Loading data: CSV, Parquet, JSON, Delta, Hive tables  
‚úÖ Writing Spark SQL queries inside PySpark  

### Transformations
‚úÖ groupBy, agg, join, withColumn  
‚úÖ UDFs (User Defined Functions) and when to avoid them (performance hit)  
‚úÖ Repartition vs Coalesce (controlling parallelism)  
‚úÖ Cache vs Persist for repeated queries  

### Scaling & Efficiency
‚úÖ Partitioning large data for parallelism (on join keys, filters)  
‚úÖ Broadcast joins (for small-to-big joins)  
‚úÖ Narrow vs Wide transformations (why shuffles kill performance)  

### Spark ML (Optional DS Add-on)
‚úÖ Use Spark MLlib pipelines for simple large-scale ML (logistic regression, clustering)  
‚úÖ Know when to **fall back to scikit-learn/TensorFlow** (better libraries for model quality, but limited to smaller datasets)

## Parallel Task Distribution in Spark
Spark distributes tasks automatically across cluster executors, but you need to **guide partitioning**:  

- **Default**: Spark splits input data into partitions (e.g., 200 MB chunks). Each executor processes one partition at a time.  
- **Control parallelism**:
  - Use `repartition(n)` to increase partitions for more parallelism.  
  - Use `coalesce(n)` to reduce partitions when data shrinks after filtering.  
  - Use partitioning keys (`df.repartition("user_id")`) to ensure related data is colocated ‚Üí avoids shuffles.  
- **Example**:  
  ```python
  # Distribute by user_id so joins/groupBy on user_id are parallelized efficiently
  df = df.repartition(200, "user_id")

### Cost Comparision


---

## How to Calculate Difference
1. Run the same ETL/analysis job in both systems.  
2. Measure runtime (wall-clock time).  
3. Multiply by resource hourly cost.  


# Cost Comparison: Spark vs Conventional Compute

To compare cost, think **time √ó resources consumed**.

---

## Conventional Source (e.g., Pandas on VM or warehouse SQL)
- **Cost** = VM/hour or warehouse credits √ó runtime  
- Limited to single machine memory/cores  

---

## Spark (clustered, distributed)
- **Cost** = (Number of Executors √ó Executor Memory √ó Executor Core √ó runtime) √ó hourly cloud rate  
- Add cost of cluster manager (Databricks, EMR, Synapse)  

Cost_spark = Executors √ó Cores_per_executor √ó Hours √ó Cost_per_core_hour
Cost_conventional = Instance_hours √ó Cost_per_instance_hour
---

## Back-of-envelope Formula

---

## Example
- **Pandas job**: 1 VM (16 cores, 64 GB RAM) √ó 3 hours √ó $0.50/hour = **$1.50**  
- **Spark job**: 4 executors (8 cores each) √ó 1 hour √ó $0.10/core-hour = **$3.20**  

üëâ Spark may cost more in raw dollars, but if runtime drops drastically (hours ‚Üí minutes) and you factor in **developer productivity + ability to process TBs instead of GBs**, Spark wins for large scale.  

---

## Stopping Point for DS
- **SQL**: go deep, since it‚Äôs your daily knife.  
- **Spark**: know enough to write efficient transformations, avoid shuffles, and distribute tasks sensibly.  
- Leave cluster sizing, infra tuning, and advanced scheduling to **Data Engineers**.
