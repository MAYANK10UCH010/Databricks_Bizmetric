# VPC vs VPS

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**  
A VPC provides an **isolated, private network environment** within a public cloud, offering extensive control over network configurations like subnets and route tables.  

**Virtual Private Server (VPS)**  
A VPS is a **single, virtualized instance** on a physical server, providing isolated server resources for hosting, but with less network control than a VPC.  

**Key Difference**  
- A **VPC** is a complete **private network offering**.  
- A **VPS** is a **virtualized server** with dedicated resources on shared hardware.
