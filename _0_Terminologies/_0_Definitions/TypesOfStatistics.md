### Different Use Cases of Statistic
- Descriptive statistics **summarize existing data** to tell "what happened," often using measures like mean and median. 
- Diagnostic statistics, on the other hand, go deeper to explain "why it happened" **by finding patterns and relationships**. 
- Predictive statistics forecast "what is likely to happen" **in the future by using past data and machine learning**. Lastly, 
- Inferential statistics **make generalizations about a larger population from a smaller sample** to test hypotheses and estimate parameters.
