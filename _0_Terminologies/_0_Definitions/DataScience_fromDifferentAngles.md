# DataScience_fromDifferentAngles

Here are several "different angles" (perspectives) on *Data Science*,
with explanation + reliable sources --- sort of a multi‑faceted lens. If
you want, we can pick one or more of these and dig even deeper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Formal / Methodological Perspective

Looks at Data Science as a discipline: its methodology, theory, relation
to statistics, computer science, etc.

-   Data Science sees itself as integrating statistical thinking,
    machine learning / AI, data management, computational techniques,
    and domain knowledge.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05852?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   Peng & Parker (2021) argue that Data Science has to define its
    *core* by focusing on the *iterative process* of data analysis:
    hypothesis generation, exploratory data analysis, validation, etc.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06324?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   Tasks in data science can be classified into **description** (what
    is), **prediction** (what will be) and **counterfactual prediction /
    causal inference** (what would happen under different conditions)
    --- Hernán, Hsu, Healy's work.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10846?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Takeaway**: from this angle, it's about clarifying what makes Data
Science *scientific*, what its methods are, what counts as evidence,
etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Application / Domain Perspective

How Data Science is used in real‑world domains (business, health,
logistics, social science, etc.), what kinds of problems it solves, and
what constraints are present.

-   Gorodetsky (2024) discusses *key directions, problems, and
    perspectives* of Data Science especially as it relates to Artificial
    Intelligence, and how DS interplays with other fields.
    ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0147688223060059?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   "Data Science in Perspective" (Rossi, 2022) sees Data Science as
    both scientific and applied---used to generate *value* in business
    projects as well as in scientific research.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05852?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Challenges** in this angle include: data availability / quality;
domain knowledge; biases; interpretability; deployment; ethics; cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Ethical / Societal / Political Perspective

Considering what Data Science *ought* to do, what consequences it has,
and the responsibilities involved.

-   "Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a
    Politics of Justice" (Ben Green, 2018) argues that data scientists
    are political actors, whether or not they want to be; that the
    choices made in modelling, data collection, etc., affect real
    people, and justice / fairness should be integral.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03435?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   Issues of bias, transparency, accountability, privacy, fairness, and
    the social impact of algorithms fit here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Learning / Skills / Education Perspective

What skills are needed; how to teach or train people; how to organize
education; what literacies matter.

-   "10 Essential Skill Sets for Data Scientists" (Tableau article)
    states that aside from technical skills (statistics, ML, coding),
    non‑technical skills like critical thinking, communication, domain
    knowledge are crucial.
    ([tableau.com](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-science-skills?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   Also, as Data Science broadens, education needs to balance depth vs
    breadth (e.g. must cover enough foundational theory while enabling
    application) --- as per Peng & Parker.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06324?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Philosophical / Epistemological Perspective

What does it mean to "know" via data; what are limits; what is validity,
what is causality, etc.

-   The classification into description / prediction / counterfactual
    (causal inference) touches epistemology: what can we infer from
    observational data, what assumptions are needed.
    ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10846?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   The "DIKW" hierarchy: Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom. This
    is more of a conceptual model: how raw data can (or cannot) turn
    into actionable insight.
    ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Storytelling / Communication / Narrative Perspective

How data gets communicated; how to frame insights; how to persuade or
inform stakeholders.

-   Dataversity's "Four Perspectives on the Art of Data Analytics"
    includes things like interpreting outliers, warning about
    over‑reliance on correlation vs causation, etc. These are not just
    methodological rules but also about narrative, how you tell the
    story.
    ([dataversity.net](https://www.dataversity.net/4-perspectives-on-the-art-of-data-analytics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   In data journalism, "angles" like *scale*, *change*, *ranking*,
    *relationship*, etc., are ways to frame a data story so audiences
    understand and care.
    ([gijn.org](https://gijn.org/stories/from-relationships-to-ranking-angles-for-your-next-data-story/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Future / Research Directions Perspective

Where the field is going: what are open problems, emerging trends, and
what might Data Science become?

-   Gorodetsky (2024) points to challenges/data science problems,
    including how to better integrate DS and AI, issues of scalability,
    interpretability, etc.
    ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0147688223060059?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\
-   The push to integrate causal inference more solidly in "real‑world"
    tasks; increasing importance of ethics, fairness, transparency;
    handling "big data" more efficiently; moving toward decision
    intelligence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want, I can map these perspectives into a framework or diagram,
or pick two (say, ethical + methodological) and contrast them via case
studies. Do you prefer that?
