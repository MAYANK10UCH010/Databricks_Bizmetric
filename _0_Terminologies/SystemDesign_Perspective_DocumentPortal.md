# System Design Perspective: Document Portal Repository

## Question
With respect to System Design only. How do you explain the uploaded folder and your approach from the perspective of SME from System Design background.  

---

## Answer

From a **System Design** perspective, this repository looks like a **document portal application** with modularized components. Let’s unpack the architecture like an SME would:

---

### 1. **High-Level View**
- The system is designed as a **modular microservice-inspired monolith** (all modules in one repo, but structured like services).
- It supports **document ingestion, analysis, comparison, and chat-based retrieval**.
- Deployment is **cloud-native** with Docker + AWS CloudFormation templates.
- CI/CD is wired via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`).

---

### 2. **Key Layers and Responsibilities**

**a. Entry Points & Interfaces**
- `api/main.py` → REST API layer (likely FastAPI/Flask).
- `templates/index.html` + `static/style.css` → Basic UI layer (thin web front).
- This suggests the system supports **API + lightweight frontend**.

**b. Configuration & Orchestration**
- `config/config.yaml` → Centralized configuration.
- `infrastructure/document-portal-cf.yaml` → Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for AWS deployment.
- `instruction_for_deployment.txt` + `Dockerfile` → Container-first deployment.

**c. Core Domain Modules (src/)**
- `document_ingestion/data_ingestion.py` → Pipeline for loading docs into the system.
- `document_analyzer/data_analysis.py` → Analytical processing of documents.
- `document_chat/retrieval.py` → Information retrieval for Q&A/chat use case.
- `document_compare/document_comparator.py` → Document-to-document comparison (diff, similarity).
- **This structure cleanly separates document lifecycle stages**.

**d. Supporting Utilities**
- `utils/config_loader.py`, `file_io.py`, `model_loader.py`, `document_ops.py` → Reusable helpers for configuration, file management, and ML model interaction.
- `logger/custom_logger.py` → Centralized logging, suggesting observability awareness.

**e. Resilience & Safety**
- `exception/custom_exception.py` + `custom_exception_archive.py` → Explicit exception handling layer.
- `prompt/prompt_library.py` → Likely stores reusable prompt templates for LLM-powered features.

**f. Models**
- `model/models.py` → Placeholder for ML/DL models (classification, embedding, etc.).
- `notebook/` → Experimental environment for prototyping ML/logging strategies before integration.

---

### 3. **System Design Thinking Behind This Structure**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each folder encapsulates a system concern (logging, exception handling, ingestion, analysis).
- **Extensibility:** Adding a new document operation (e.g., summarization) is as simple as creating a new `src/document_summarizer/` module.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Docker + AWS CloudFormation hints at containerized workloads with infrastructure reproducibility.
- **Scalability Readiness:** Even though it’s monolithic now, the folder breakdown allows migration to microservices later (each `document_*` module could become its own service).
- **Observability:** Logging, exceptions, and CI/CD pipelines show awareness of production-grade reliability.

---

### 4. **How I Would Explain the Approach as SME**
This repository is essentially a **document processing platform** designed with modularity and cloud deployment in mind. The design emphasizes:

1. **Pipeline-oriented flow**: Documents go through ingestion → analysis → retrieval/chat → comparison.  
2. **Cross-cutting concerns abstracted out**: Logging, exceptions, and configuration are centralized instead of duplicated.  
3. **DevOps baked in**: Docker, CI/CD, and IaC ensure smooth delivery to production.  
4. **Experimentation loop**: Notebooks and prompt libraries allow quick iteration without destabilizing the main codebase.  

In a real-world system design discussion, I’d present this as a **service-oriented monolithic system** that is **modular, cloud-ready, and ML-integrated**, with a clear path to **microservice decomposition** as scale demands.

# Architectural Diagram: Document Portal System Design

## Overview
This architecture shows how the system handles document ingestion, analysis, chat, and comparison, while integrating with API/UI and cloud deployment.

---

## Layers

### 1. UI/API Layer (Top)
- **Purpose:** User-facing entry point for APIs and minimal web UI.

### 2. Core Document Modules (Middle Row)
- **Ingestion:** Handles document uploads and preprocessing.  
- **Analysis:** Performs document analysis using ML models.  
- **Chat:** Enables conversational interaction with documents.  
- **Comparison:** Compares documents for similarity or differences.  

> Each module interacts with models and storage as needed.

### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Utilities, Logging, Config:** Services shared across all core modules for monitoring, configuration, and logging.

### 4. Models & Storage (Bottom Row)
- **ML Models:** Used for document analysis and chat.  
- **Persisted Documents:** Stored in S3 or a database.

### 5. Deployment
- **Docker + AWS CloudFormation:** Orchestrates the entire stack and ensures smooth cloud deployment.

---

## Flow Description
- The architecture is pipeline-like:
  1. User interacts with **UI/API**.
  2. Documents are sent to **Ingestion**.
  3. **Analysis** processes the document.
  4. **Chat** and **Comparison** modules provide interactive features.
  5. All modules utilize **Models & Storage**.
  6. The system runs on a **Docker + AWS CloudFormation** deployment.
