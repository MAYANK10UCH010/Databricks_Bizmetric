# Define and Differentiate  

## 1. Vector Search vs. Vector Search Index  

**Vector Search**  
- A method of searching data based on similarity of vector representations (embeddings) instead of exact matching.  
- Example: Given an image, find other images that “look similar” rather than those with the same filename.  
- Uses distance metrics like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product.  

**Vector Search Index**  
- The underlying data structure or algorithm that enables *fast retrieval* of similar vectors during vector search.  
- Examples:  
  - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** – In-memory indexing.  
  - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs)** – Graph-based index.  
  - **IVF, PQ (Inverted File, Product Quantization)** – Partitioning and compression techniques.  
- Without an index, vector search is slow (linear scan). With an index, it scales to billions of vectors.  

👉 **Key Difference**:  
- *Vector Search* = the process.  
- *Vector Search Index* = the engine that powers it efficiently.

## 2. Vector Embeddings  

- **Definition**: Numerical representations of data (text, image, audio, video) in a high-dimensional vector space.  
- Purpose: Capture semantic meaning so that *similar things are close together*.  
- Example:  
  - Text: “king – man + woman ≈ queen”  
  - Images: A cat photo embedding is closer to another cat photo than to a car photo.  
- Generated by neural models like BERT, OpenAI’s text-embedding models, CLIP, etc.  

👉 **They are the raw inputs used for vector search.**

## 3. Vector Database  

- **Definition**: A specialized database designed to store, index, and query vector embeddings efficiently.  
- Features:  
  - Stores high-dimensional vectors.  
  - Provides fast similarity search (cosine, Euclidean, dot product).  
  - Supports vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF).  
  - Often hybrid: supports metadata + structured filters with vectors.  
- Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Chroma, Redis-Vector.  

👉 **Difference from traditional DB**: Traditional DBs store structured/tabular data and retrieve exact matches. Vector DBs store embeddings and retrieve by similarity.

## 🔄 Hierarchy / Flow  

1. **Vector Embeddings** → numerical representations of raw data.  
2. **Vector Database** → stores embeddings and metadata.  
3. **Vector Search Index** → optimizes similarity search inside the database.  
4. **Vector Search** → the act of finding “most similar” items using embeddings + index.
