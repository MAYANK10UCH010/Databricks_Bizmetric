# 📁 Data Structures Q&A (From Live Session)

## 1. Built-in Data Structures

### Q1: What are the built-in data structures in Python?
**A:**
- List  
- Tuple  
- Set  
- Dictionary  

---

### Q2: Can a list store different data types?
**A:**  
Yes, a list can store elements of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).

---

### Q3: Are lists and arrays the same?
**A:**  
No. Arrays store homogeneous elements (same data type), while lists can store heterogeneous elements.

---

### Q4: How can we use built-in data structures in a modular/project-based way?
**A:**  
We can create separate Python files (modules) for each data structure and define reusable functions or classes.  
For example:

## 2. Custom/Advanced Data Structures

### Q5: What is a linked list?
**A:**  
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next.  
It’s like a chain of people where each person knows who comes next.

---

### Q6: Is there a built-in linked list in Python?
**A:**  
No. You have to implement it using classes and nodes.

---

### Q7: What is a stack?
**A:**  
A stack is a **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** structure.  
Example: Stack of chairs — you can only add or remove from the top.

---

### Q8: What is a queue?
**A:**  
A queue is a **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** structure.  
Example: People standing in a line — first person in is the first out.

---

### Q9: What is a tree?
**A:**  
A tree is a hierarchical structure with a root and child nodes.  
Example: File system, family tree.

---

### Q10: What is a graph?
**A:**  
A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges.  
Example: Social network, metro map.

---

## 3. Real-World Use Cases

### Q11: Where are stacks used in real life?
**A:**
- Browser back button  
- Undo/Redo in editors  

---

### Q12: Where are queues used?
**A:**
- Ticket booking systems  
- Task scheduling  

---

### Q13: Where are graphs used?
**A:**
- Google Maps  
- Social networks  
- Recommendation systems  

---

## 4. Project: Task Management System

### Q14: How did we use data structures in the project?
**A:**
- **List** → Store tasks  
- **Dictionary** → Store users  
- **Queue** → Manage task assignment order  
- **Stack** → Track task history  
- **Graph** → Handle task dependencies (optional)

---

### Q15: What was the project structure?
**A:**

```
task_management_system/
│
├── models/
│ ├── task.py
│ ├── user.py
│ ├── queue.py
│ ├── stack.py
│ └── graph.py
│
├── services/
│ ├── task_service.py
│ └── user_service.py
│
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```



---

### Q16: How did we implement the queue?
**A:**  
We used `collections.deque` for efficient append and pop operations from both ends.

---

### Q17: How did we track task history?
**A:**  
Using a **stack**. When a task is completed, it’s pushed to the stack.

---

## 5. Common Questions from the Session

### Q18: Why learn data structures for data science?
**A:**
- Efficient data handling  
- Better algorithm design  
- Required for tech interviews (FAANG, etc.)

---

### Q19: Should I use Jupyter or VS Code for projects?
**A:**  
Use **VS Code** for projects (modular, scalable).  
Jupyter is great for learning and exploration.

---

### Q20: How long does it take to learn DSA?
**A:**  
Around **3–6 months** with consistent practice.
