# Expert-Level Questions on Hudi, Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Parquet

---

## 🔎 From Past Chat History
You already asked:  
- *“Explain the technology related to initiatives around Hudi, Iceberg, or Delta”*  
- *“Difference between Delta tables and Snowflake tables”*  
- *“Difference between Delta tables and Snow Flake tables (converted to markdown)”*  

So yes, some **introductory-to-intermediate questions** have already been framed in your past conversations.  
But you haven’t yet asked **expert-level scenario-based questions** for Hudi, Iceberg, Delta, or Parquet.

## ⚡ Expert-Level Question Bank

### 1. **Apache Hudi**
- How does Hudi manage incremental data ingestion compared to Delta and Iceberg, and in what use cases does its *Merge-on-Read* table type outperform *Copy-on-Write*?  
- Explain how Hudi leverages *timeline service* and *commit protocols* for consistency in streaming use cases.  
- In what scenarios would you choose Hudi over Delta Lake when working with CDC (Change Data Capture) pipelines on cloud data lakes?  

---

### 2. **Apache Iceberg**
- How does Iceberg’s hidden partitioning eliminate the need for user-defined partition strategies? Give an example where this feature significantly reduces query complexity.  
- Compare Iceberg’s snapshot-based isolation model with Hudi’s timeline model for concurrent writes. Which is more efficient for multi-tenant workloads?  
- Explain how Iceberg integrates with query engines (Spark, Trino, Flink) and how its catalog abstraction differs from Hive Metastore.  

---

### 3. **Delta Lake**
- Explain how Delta Lake’s transaction log (Delta Log) ensures ACID guarantees over cloud object stores like S3, ADLS, or GCS.  
- How does Delta’s *time travel* differ from Iceberg’s *snapshot-based* rollback mechanism?  
- Discuss how Delta Lake optimizes Z-order clustering for large-scale analytical queries.  

---

### 4. **Parquet**
- Why is Parquet considered columnar but still supports nested schema structures? Explain with an example of struct/array schema.  
- How does Parquet’s *dictionary encoding* and *run-length encoding* improve performance for high-cardinality vs low-cardinality columns?  
- When reading Parquet files with Spark, how does predicate pushdown work, and what are the limitations compared to Iceberg’s metadata pruning?

## 🎯 Cross-Technology (Comparative Expert Questions)
- In what scenarios would you choose **Iceberg over Delta**, or **Hudi over Parquet**, given performance, governance, and streaming requirements?  
- How do **schema evolution strategies** differ across Parquet, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi? Which handles *column rename* best and why?  
- For **streaming ingestion + batch analytics (Lambda architecture)**, which of the three (Hudi, Iceberg, Delta) gives the lowest latency and why?  
- How do *compaction* and *vacuuming* differ between Hudi’s MOR, Iceberg’s snapshots, and Delta’s file management?
