# Tax Filing: Old vs New Regime

## 1. Basics of the Two Regimes  

| Feature | **Old Regime** | **New Regime (introduced FY 2020-21, revised FY 2023-24 onwards)** |
|---------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tax Rates/Slabs** | Higher rates, but you can claim **~70+ deductions & exemptions** | Lower rates, but **most deductions & exemptions removed** |
| **Deductions Allowed?** | ✅ Yes — e.g., 80C (PF, LIC, ELSS), 80D (Health Insurance), HRA, LTA, Home Loan Interest, Standard Deduction, etc. | ❌ Mostly No — only a few allowed like employer NPS contribution (80CCD(2)), standard deduction (₹50,000 for salaried), family pension deduction, and some special cases. |
| **Flexibility** | Good if you have many investments, insurance, loans, rent (HRA), etc. | Good if you don’t claim many deductions or prefer simpler filing |
| **Complexity** | More paperwork/document proof | Easier, fewer calculations |

## 2. Current Slabs (FY 2023-24 onwards, i.e. AY 2024-25)

### 🟢 New Regime (Default now from FY 23-24)
| Income (₹) | Tax Rate |
|------------|----------|
| 0 – 3,00,000 | Nil |
| 3,00,001 – 6,00,000 | 5% |
| 6,00,001 – 9,00,000 | 10% |
| 9,00,001 – 12,00,000 | 15% |
| 12,00,001 – 15,00,000 | 20% |
| Above 15,00,000 | 30% |

👉 Rebate under **87A**: If income ≤ ₹7 lakh, tax = **zero** under New Regime.

### 🔵 Old Regime
| Income (₹) | Tax Rate |
|------------|----------|
| 0 – 2,50,000 | Nil |
| 2,50,001 – 5,00,000 | 5% |
| 5,00,001 – 10,00,000 | 20% |
| Above 10,00,000 | 30% |

👉 Rebate under **87A**: If income ≤ ₹5 lakh, tax = **zero** under Old Regime.

## 3. Which One to Choose? (Rule of Thumb)

- **Choose New Regime if:**
  - Your salary is straightforward and you don’t claim many deductions.  
  - You don’t have home loans, large insurance premiums, or HRA claims.  
  - Your income is ≤ ₹7 lakh → Zero tax under new regime.  

- **Choose Old Regime if:**
  - You make use of deductions like:
    - 80C (PF, LIC, ELSS, PPF, tuition fees) – up to ₹1.5L  
    - 80D (health insurance) – ₹25k/50k  
    - HRA, LTA, Home Loan interest  
    - NPS (80CCD(1B) – ₹50k extra)  
  - Your deductions & exemptions cross at least ₹3–3.5L (typical breakeven point).

## 4. Example Comparison  

Suppose **Salaried Person, Income = ₹12,00,000**  

- **Old Regime (with deductions):**  
  - 80C: ₹1.5L  
  - 80D: ₹25k  
  - Standard Deduction: ₹50k  
  - HRA/Home loan interest: ₹1L  
  - **Total deductions = ₹3.25L**  
  - Taxable income = 8.75L → Tax ≈ ₹87,500 (before cess)  

- **New Regime (no deductions except standard deduction):**  
  - Taxable = 11.5L → Tax ≈ ₹1,25,000 (before cess)  

✅ In this case, **Old Regime is better**.

## 5. How to File

- **At the start of FY** → inform employer which regime you want (for TDS).  
- **At filing (ITR time)** → you can change your choice (only restriction: business/profession income individuals have limited switches).  
- In **ITR portal** → you’ll see two options: "Opt for new regime" or "Continue with old regime."

## 6. Decision Shortcut

- If you **save/invest heavily** (PF, LIC, ELSS, home loan, insurance, HRA) → Old Regime usually wins.  
- If you **don’t claim many deductions** → New Regime gives lower tax and simplicity.
