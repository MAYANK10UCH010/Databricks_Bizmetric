# ICICI Meal Card Usage in Bengaluru

## How the ICICI Meal Card decides where it works
- It’s a **Visa prepaid card** and works at merchants whose **MCC (Merchant Category Code)** is food/grocery (e.g., restaurants, cafés, bakeries, supermarkets).  
- That’s why some stores work and others don’t, even if they accept normal cards.

## Quick Usage Tips for Bengaluru
1. **Think “MCC,” not brand**  
   If a branch’s POS is coded as “F&B/Grocery,” your meal card should work; if it’s coded “department store/general retail,” it won’t.  

2. **At checkout, say “bill it as food/grocery”**  
   Staff often have multiple terminals or a category selection. Asking them to use the **food/grocery POS** often fixes declines.  

3. **Prefer in-store swipes/taps over delivery**  
   Online acceptance for Swiggy/Zomato varies by employer settings. Expect variability; try a small order first.   

4. **When it declines, the usual culprits are:**  
   - Wrong MCC/terminal category  
   - Insufficient balance / wrong PIN  
   - Online usage blocked or OTP not completed (for e-commerce)   

5. **Carry a backup card for mixed-MCC stores**  
   Big hypermarkets with electronics/homeware often fail because the entire store is coded “general retail,” not “grocery.”

## Bengaluru-Specific Convenience Hacks
- **Pick grocery-first outlets:** Pay at Reliance Smart (grocery MCC) instead of Reliance Trends (general retail).  
- **Cloud kitchens with counters:** Use ICICI Meal Card at FreshMenu / Faasos kitchens in-person, not always via apps.  
- **Mall food courts:** Try the **central cash counter** if individual stalls fail.  
- **Ask for alternate terminal:** Some stalls keep two POS machines.  
- **Split bills:** Buy edibles separately to ensure grocery MCC billing.

## About Swiggy / Zomato / Online Grocery
- **Expect inconsistency.** Some corporates allow ICICI Meal Wallet for Swiggy/Zomato; others block it. Test with small orders.   
- **Instamart / Zepto / BigBasket:** Works only if routed under a grocery MCC **and** e-commerce is enabled.

## How to Test an Outlet
1. Make a **₹10–₹50** test swipe at the counter.  
2. If it fails, ask staff to try the **“restaurant/food” terminal**.  
3. If still fails, the outlet MCC is ineligible. Mark it as **No**.  
4. For online: attempt a **small cart**; if OTP fails, your wallet or site MCC is blocked.
